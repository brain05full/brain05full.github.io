        <u>The tale of the car born with no brakes</u><br><br>
        
        This is the tale of a car born without brakes<br>
        He has never been able to stop moving. No matter how hard he’s tried<br>
        And he’s tried. A lot<br>
        He’s always gotten good grades in his driving exams, is the varsity captain of his school’s racing team, and always tells his mom he loves her every night<br>
        But, he has never been able to slow down<br>
        His mom has been telling him: “Y’know, your aunt was a late boomer too, it’ll come in time, sweetie”<br>
        Yet, despite his mother’s patience and love,<br> 
        Frustrated with the world, he went on a drive<br><br>
        
        Away from the city, his garage, his mom’s gas station on the corner of the block<br>
        Onto the backroads, where the trees fill the sky so high all you see is a rush of brown and green<br>
        Where pavement crumples into dirt, tree roots, and purple loosestrife line the sides of the road<br>
        He rolled down the windows, to let the crisp air flow in, the scent of pine needles, grass, mulch, and the occasional wisp of flowers<br><br>
        
        The rain started to sprinkle<br>
        And, then pour<br>
        And the little dial of his speedometer started inching its way in a direction it’s never been before<br>
        With the rain sputtering off his windshield<br>
        He couldn’t see very well or feel any of his other senses<br>
        Till he finally<br>
        slowed<br> 
        to<br> 
        a<br> 
        stop.<br><br>
        
        The rain beated off his roof,<br>
        His hood,<br>
        Dripped down his doors<br>
        And, there he was<br>
        Stopped<br>
        Alone<br><br>
        
        “Jesus fucking christ<br>
        “JESUS fucking christ<br>
        “FUCK”<br>
        He only could exclaim profanities at this point<br>
        He looked down at his fuel gauge and his dial was well past empty<br>
        A point he’s never been before<br><br>
        
        The rain pattered<br>
        The droplets slowed to a sprinkle<br>
        When the clouds finally parted, there she was:<br>
        The stop sign who’s stood the test of time<br><br>
        
        She saw everything<br>
        She stood as he approached her, knowing she was unnoticed as the clouds and rain covered him and his mind<br><br>
        
        She stood as a mother bird created a home behind her<br>
        As she collected her twigs, pine needles, and long grasses to build her home, nestled in her metal frame<br>
        As she laid her eggs, one by one<br>
        As she sat in her home, ensuring the warmth and love for her babies<br>
        She watched as the mother stayed with her children every day<br><br>
        
        The eggs cracked<br>
        Soon, the baby birds emerged into their new landscape, crying, confused, suddenly immersed in a whole new world<br><br>
        
        She watched as flowers bloomed around her, from compact buds<br>
        their petals spreading<br> 
        little by little<br>
        each day<br><br>
        
        She shared these thoughts with him<br>
        Thoughts he never saw<br>
        in his days in the city<br><br>
        
        And there they sat<br>
        Sharing their thoughts<br>
        Reminiscing on unshared memories<br>
        Giggling in their silly little world<br><br>
        
        The rain poured,<br>
        The sun beat,<br>
        The leaves fell,<br>
        The snow blanketed their world<br><br>
        
        And there they sat<br>
        Grass growing up around them<br>
        Their metal and paint chipped away<br>
        Ladybugs found little homes in their cracks<br><br>
        
        There they were<br>
        Finally stopped<br>
        Together<br>
        for time immemorial<br><br>
